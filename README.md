# HackathonStarter
Well-documented hackathon starter code using Meteorjs and Reactjs

## Goals
* Well documented starter code
* Works on linux and OS X (windows planned in the future)
* Easily extensible into a common hackathon-like application

## Base Components
* Meteorjs: Used for real time data consistency across all clients (MongoDB backend)
* Reactjs: Used for easy, reactive views on the client. 
  * React-Router: Allows for url-based routing on the client side, decreasing overall load times in the application
